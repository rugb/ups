# UPS - University Project System

UPS is a CMS/Weblog/Groupware especially designed for student projects of the Department
for Computer Science of the [Univertät Bremen](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de).

Intentionally, this piece of software was written by [Dennis Börm](https://github.com/allspark)
and [Philip Häusler](https://github.com/msquare). The idea came initially from
[Dominik Menke](https://github.com/dmke).

# Installation
